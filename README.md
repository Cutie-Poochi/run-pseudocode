# Run Pseudocode

Runs pseudocode with syntax based on [this syllabus (from page 35).](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/Images/595444-2023-2025-syllabus.pdf) 

Currently can only store integres and floats in a variable and output that variable, will add more features later.

Example:
```
brownie <- 5.3
variable <- -8.6

OUTPUT variable
OUTPUT brownie
```
Output:
```
-8.6
5.3
```
